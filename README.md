### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pavel from Romania, and I am studying Data Engineering as a Master's program at the Faculty of Cybernetics, Statistics and Informatics from Bucharest University of Economic Studies. I am most interested
in fields such as web development, web design, mobile applications and AI, and I strive to become an expert in at least one of these areas.
